We want to create a tool that will help us collect context to be given to LLMs and coding agents. The aim is to make it easy to capture context from different sources (multiple websites, apps etc) and use it. For example, if I'm working on a feature, I may have context from jira, confluence, slack channels, from my own source code etc. I want to be able to easily capture all this context and use it together.

Here is how it should work:

- When using my mac, I trigger this tool
- The tool then captures the context that's on the screen (or from the selected open app)
- It then summarizes or transcribes the context
- It may or may not associate the context with another context, adding on to it or linking to it. OR it may just be a standalone context.
- I should also be able to see the context, modify it.
- I should also be able to manually associate it with another context. or break it down into smaller contexts. or if it's automatically linked, I should be able to break the link.

Later on,

When using an LLM or coding agent, I can decide to use one or more of the contexts that have been collected. I can open the app, see all the contexts, select one or more, and then use them (copy to paste later).

This should be a very easy to use tool, easy to capture context, and easy to use the context later.
